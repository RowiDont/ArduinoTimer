# ArduinoTimer

###Purpose
The purpose of this program is to create an interval timer that can be paused and resumed. Eventually an LCD output will be added to the code (once I decide to purchase one).

###Use
Just download the Timer.ino file and upload it to your arduino! Also make sure you've created a working circuit.
